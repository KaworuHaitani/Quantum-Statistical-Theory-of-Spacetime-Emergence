abstract: >
  This hypothesis proposes that the structure of spacetime emerges from the statistical aggregation of quantum correlations. 
  With quantum state number N_q as the driver, the stability of time and space follows a 1/N_q scaling. The spatial dimension 
  is determined as the solution to a statistical optimization problem, with three dimensions observed due to balance at critical
  values of N_q. The theory unifies explanations from biological systems (e.g., rotational fluctuations in ATP synthase) to 
  artificial quantum devices and cosmological phenomena (e.g., CMB temperature fluctuations). This theory extends the concept 
  of emergent spacetime in quantum gravity from a statistical perspective, providing falsifiable predictions.
