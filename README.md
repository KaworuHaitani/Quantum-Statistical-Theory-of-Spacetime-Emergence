# Quantum Statistical Theory of Spacetime Emergence

## Overview

This repository contains the theoretical framework and supporting materials for the "Quantum Statistical Theory of Spacetime Emergence." This theory proposes that the structure of spacetime emerges from the statistical aggregation of quantum correlations, with quantum state number (N_q) as the fundamental driver.

## Key Propositions

- **1/N_q Scaling Law**: The stability of time and space follows a 1/N_q scaling, providing a quantitative basis for the emergence of classical spacetime from quantum fluctuations.
  
- **Dimensional Optimization**: The observed three-dimensional space emerges as the solution to a statistical optimization problem balancing causal stability, information retention, and energy dissipation.
  
- **Unified Framework**: This theory connects phenomena across biological systems (ATP synthase fluctuations), quantum devices, and cosmological observations (CMB temperature fluctuations).

- **Falsifiable Predictions**: The theory offers testable predictions about scale-dependent effective dimensions and stability optimization across different physical systems.
